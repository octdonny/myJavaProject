Programming Principles 2

March 22, 2018
I have completed all main requirements for the JavaFX Project
There is a Home / Main View (with an intro and animation), Author View (with video, pictures and description) and Game View

There are a however, few things I failed at adding into my Game
- Points system
- Covering images after failed guess
- Also there are a few bugs in the game.
